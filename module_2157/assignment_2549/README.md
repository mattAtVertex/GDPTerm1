# Assignment 01: Level Design: Point of Interest

<p>This assignment, you will create a point of interest using assets from Quixel Bridge. The idea here is to get a relatively contained object together using kitbashing. Try to think in terms of a monumental structure. We will go over some examples in the live session.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assignment submission</p>
<p>Please submit your project with 5 high resolution screenshots from UE. When you take the screenshots, try to focus on highlighting the interesting parts of your&nbsp; Point of Interest</p>
<p>In addition to your own submission, you must complete at least one peer review of another classmates work. To do this, you will find 5 things that are working visually with the screenshots and 5 things that can be better.&nbsp;</p>
