# GDP Milestone 2: Landscapes Lesson Plan

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Objective</strong></span></p>
<p>In this sprint, you will will create a landscape and an atmosphere in Unreal Engine.</p>
<p>A landscape has 3 components:&nbsp;Landscape,&nbsp;Landscape Material,&nbsp;Foliage. &nbsp;For the project, you will create a complete Landscape that suits the environment design for your game. &nbsp;We will work with Megascans surfaces for our textures and use foliage from Megascans as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An atmosphere has 5 components:&nbsp;Sky Atmosphere Actor,&nbsp;Volumetric Cloud Actor,&nbsp;Exponential Height fog Actor,&nbsp;Directional Light Actor,&nbsp;Skylight Actor. &nbsp;These actors all exist in the engine and combine to create an atmosphere.</p>
